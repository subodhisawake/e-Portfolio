            <h2>Live Animation (15 Seconds)</h2>
            <p>This project is a concise, 15-second animated scientific explanation created in Adobe Animate, designed to visually communicate the highly specific, rapid, and cyclical nature of Enzyme-Substrate Interaction following the Lock-and-Key Model. The animation utilizes minimal, meaningful text and vector graphics to communicate complex biochemical relationships.</p>

            <!-- Technical Breakdown -->
            <h2>Technical & Artistic Manipulations</h2>
            <p>The animation was constructed to adhere to all minimum technical requirements, with a focus on visually communicating a higher-level cognitive topic.</p>

            <ul class="technical-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Vector Graphics & Color:</strong>
                    The core assets—the complex, keyhole-shaped Enzyme and the perfectly fitting Substrate—were designed as vector images for scale independence. Meaningful color was essential: the static Enzyme was Blue (constant catalyst), the reactive Substrate was Yellow, and the resulting Products were distinguished with Green and Red.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Motion Tweening (Movement & Rotation):</strong>
                    Motion Tweening was used to animate the Substrate moving precisely into the Enzyme's active site. A subtle Rotation Tween was incorporated as the Substrate locked into place, emphasizing the exact structural fit of the reaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transformation & Transition Effects:</strong>
                    The catalytic transformation was shown using a blend of effects: the Substrate's shape underwent a Scaling effect to visually represent its breaking apart, and an Alpha Tween (a Fade/Dissolve effect) was simultaneously applied to its color, symbolizing the chemical transformation into the new Product molecules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Text and Voice-Over Integration:</strong>
                    Textual information was kept minimal, limited only to key labels like "Enzyme," "Substrate," and "Products," appearing momentarily. The final video was supported by a pre-scripted voice-over component, which was recorded and synced using a video editor to further explain the on-screen animation content.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section class="card troubleshooting-box">
            <h2>Troubleshooting Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p>The most significant technical challenge involved overcoming an export failure from the Adobe Animate trial version.</p>
            <h3>Solution: Image Sequence Assembly</h3>
            <p>The animation was successfully exported as an Image Sequence, yielding 459 individual PNG frames. These frames were then imported into Microsoft Clipchamp, a video editor, where they were reassembled to form the final video timeline. This detailed, frame-by-frame approach allowed for the successful integration of the voice-over and captions, ensuring the final deliverable met all technical and quality standards despite the initial software hurdle.</p>
