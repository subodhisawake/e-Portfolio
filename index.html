            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Subodh Bhyri, and I'm currently studying Masters in Computer Science at the University of Florida. This e-Portfolio serves as a showcase for the projects and assignments completed during this course. I'm passionate about web development, and I aim to use these projects to demonstrate my growing understanding of the course material and my ability to apply theoretical concepts to practical challenges. Please explore my work below!</p>
